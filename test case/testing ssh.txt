Test Case: Testing SSH Connectivity using Password and Key-based Authentication

Test Scenario: Testing SSH Connectivity using Password and Key-based Authentication using VirtualBox and Unix VM

Prerequisite: OpenSSH, VirtualBox (with Unix-based VM)

Test Setup:

1.Set up a VirtualBox VM:

2.Set up the SSH Server and Client:
2.1 Launch the VM and log in as the administrator or a user with administrative privileges
2.2 Install the OpenSSH server: "sudo apt-get install openssh-server"
2.3 Configure SSH Server:
2.3.1 Open the SSH server configuration file using a text editor: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2.3.2 configure the following property:
AllowPasswordAuthentication yes (for password-based authentication)
PubkeyAuthentication yes (for key-based authentication)
2.3.3 Restart the SSH server to apply the configuration changes using "sudo service ssh restart"

Test steps:
1. Test SSH Connectivity using Password-based Authentication:
1.1. Open a terminal or command prompt within the VM.
1.2. Connect to the SSH server using password authentication "ssh [username]@<IP_address_or_hostname>"
1.3  Enter the password associated with the SSH user.
1.4  Verify that you can successfully log in and obtain a command-line interface on the local SSH server.
1.5. Exit the SSH session by typing exit or logout.

2.Test SSH Connectivity using Key-based Authentication:
2.1. Generate an SSH key pair on the VM using the ssh-keygen command.
2.2. Add the public key (id_rsa.pub) to the VM. using "ssh-copy-id <username>@<IP_address_or_hostname>"
2.3. Connect to the local SSH server using key-based authentication:"ssh <username>@<IP_address_or_hostname>"
2.4  Verify that you can successfully log in and obtain a command-line interface on the local SSH server.
2.5. Exit the SSH session by typing exit or logout.

Expected result:
Step 1.3: The SSH connection using password authentication should be successful.
Step 2.3: The SSH connection using key-based authentication should be successful without requiring a password.
